//Exercise 1. Write a test method that calls your Max method from Exercise 0 and then asserts something about the result.

method Max(a: int, b:int) returns (c: int)
  // Use your code from Exercise 0
method Testing() {
  // Assert some things about Max. Does it operate as you expect?
  // If it does not, can you think of a way to fix it?
}
