//Exercise 11. Write a method that takes an integer array, which it requires to have at least one element, and returns an index to the maximum of the arrayâ€™s elements. Annotate the method with pre- and postconditions that state the intent of the method, and annotate its body with loop invariant to verify it.

method FindMax(a: array<int>) returns (i: int)
  requires 0 < a.Length 
  ensures 0 <= i < a.Length 
  ensures forall k :: 0 <= k < a.Length ==> a[k] <= a[i]
{
  i := 0;
  var index: int := 1; 
  while index != a.Length 
    invariant 1 <= index <= a.Length 
    invariant 0 <= i < index
    invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < index ==> a[k] <= a[i]
  {
    if a[i] < a[index] {
      i := index;
    } 
    index := index + 1;
  }
}
